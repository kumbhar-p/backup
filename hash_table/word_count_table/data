 extern simply tells us that the variable is defined 
 elsewhere and not within the same block where it is used. 
 Basically, the value is assigned to it in a different block and this can be 
 overwritten changed in a different block as well. So an extern variable 
 is nothing but a global variable initialized with a legal value where 
 it is declared in order to be used elsewhere. It can be accessed 
 within any function block. Also, a normal global variable 
 can me made extern as well by placing the extern
 keyword before its declaration definition in any function block. 
 This basically signifies that we are not initializing a new variable but
 instead we are using/accessing the global variable only. The main purpose of 
 using extern variables is that they can be accessed between two different files 
 which are part of a large program.
